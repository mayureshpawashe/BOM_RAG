the option of servicing the interest is with the borrower
. The concession is available for the moratorium period only. However, minimum applicable ROI shouldn’t be below RLLR as floor rate.
As a uniform procedure, branches should offer the option to the borrowers either to service the interest during the moratorium period as and when applied and avail 1 % concession or opt for the repayment of interest together with principal after completion of the course/moratorium. Needless to say that in later option, no interest concessions is to be provided.

In respect of borrowers availing 1 % interest rate concession, branch should apply Interest at specified rate (without any concession) as per sanction letter. Branch should ensure that the interest is serviced as and when applied. Servicing of interest means repayment of interest amount debited to the loan account within 30 days. In eligible cases, at the time of regeneration of repayment schedule one month before repayment start date, manually interest @1% per annum will be reversed & credited to SB Account of the Borrower.
